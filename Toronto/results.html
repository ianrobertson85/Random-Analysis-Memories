I'm really late to this Toronto election party, but I was casting about for some reason to play around with some data out of the <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=834689fe9c18b210VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD">City of Toronto Open Data catalogue</a>.  I also wanted to play around a bit with matplotlib, since I've never had a good reason to do so.  So without further ado, here's what I came up with:
</p>
<h2>2014 election - Ford (Doug) v. Tory v. Chow</h2>

<img src="2014_overall.png" alt="Overall Results">
<p>
What really strikes me about the past two elections featuring a Ford is how ridiculously correlated voting is with geography.  We're not talking 55% to 45% - the "upside-down T" that follows the TTC subway line hits lows of 10-20% Ford supporters, and 80-90% Tory/Chow supporters.  Vice versa for the Etobicoke bloc.

<h2>2010 election - Ford (Rob) v. Smitherman v. Pantalone (kinda)</h2>

<h2>2006 election - Miller v. Pitfield v. LeDrew (not really)</h2>
<img src="2006.png" alt="Results">
<img src="2006_overall.png" alt="Overall Results">
<p>
Miller was the last mayor we had that really united the city geographically.  I'm worried that the recent trend of geographic devisiveness will just keep going -
